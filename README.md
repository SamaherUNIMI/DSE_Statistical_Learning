# DSE_Statistical_Learning_Project

This project explores the application of both unsupervised and supervised learning techniques in analyzing Womenâ€™s Tennis Association (WTA) data. 

## Overview

The unsupervised aspect involves clustering the top 30 players, while the supervised part focuses on building predictive models for match outcomes. The dataset comprises a variety of player performance metrics, attributes, and match characteristics. 

## Methodology

In the unsupervised learning phase, methods such as principal component analysis (PCA), k-medoids, and hierarchical clustering are used to uncover player segments and patterns within the data. On the supervised learning front, logistic regression, classification tree, and random forest models are employed to predict match outcomes based on player and match attributes.
