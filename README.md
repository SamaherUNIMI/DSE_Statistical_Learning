# DSE Statistical Learning Project

This project explores the application of both unsupervised and supervised learning techniques in analyzing Womenâ€™s Tennis Association (WTA) data.

## Overview

The project aims to provide insights into WTA data using a combination of unsupervised and supervised learning methods. 

### Key Components:

ðŸ‘‰ **Presentation:** Provides an overview of the project and its findings, offering a high-level perspective.
ðŸ‘‰ **Report:** Offers a detailed analysis of the methodologies, results, and interpretations.
ðŸ‘‰ **Notebook:** Contains the R code used for analysis, allowing for transparency and reproducibility.

## Methodology

The unsupervised aspect involves clustering the top 30 players, while the supervised part focuses on building predictive models for match outcomes. The dataset comprises a variety of player performance metrics, attributes, and match characteristics. 

### Techniques Used:

- **Unsupervised Learning:** Utilizes methods such as principal component analysis (PCA), k-medoids, and hierarchical clustering to uncover player segments and patterns within the data.
- **Supervised Learning:** Employs logistic regression, classification tree, and random forest models to predict match outcomes based on player and match attributes.
